# Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a "Game Engine Jam", in which teams of up to 3 create & present a game engine built around a given theme, complete with a game to show off the functionality & flexibility of the engine. The theme for this given engine is "contemplation", and requires implementing a level system & difficulty layering.
