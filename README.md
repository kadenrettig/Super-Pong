The goal of this project is to simulate a "Game Engine Jam", in which teams of up to 3 create & present a game engine built around a given theme, complete with a game to show off the functionality & flexibility of the engine. The theme for this given engine is "contemplation", and requires implementing a level system & difficulty layering. 

## Showcase
<p>
  <b> Title Screen </b> </br>
  Upon loading the game, a custom title screen is shown with interactable buttons. </br>

  <b> Game Screen </b> </br>
  The game features two player-controlled paddles that are used to reflect the ball back at the opponent. </br>

  <b> Difficulty System </b> </br>
  When either player scores 3 points, a new level is reached. Each level introduces more obstacles & increased ball speed, </br>
  making it harder to predict where the ball will end up and forcing the player to anticipate its movement. </br>
